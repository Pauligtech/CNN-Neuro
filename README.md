# DL for Early Detection of Neurodevelopmental Disorders
# Introduction: 
Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) exhibit significant heterogeneity, with varied symptoms among individuals, making detection challenging based solely on physiological changes. While genetics may contribute to these disorders, the precise causes remain unknown. Without early intervention, these disorders may persist throughout an individual's life. Common examples include Autism, ADHD, and Schizophrenia. Advanced technologies are essential for the identification of NDDs. The preference for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technologies, such as electroencephalography (EEG), in identifying NDDs is based on their capacity to measure brain activity through the detection of electrical signals or variations in neural activity. The proposed deep learning system employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for the detection of Schizophrenia disorders. The system's performance was validated by feeding EEG data comprising 14 Schizophrenia patients and 14 healthy controls from open repository datasets. The findings indicate that early intervention in schizophrenia could potentially prevent the onset of mental disorders in patients.
